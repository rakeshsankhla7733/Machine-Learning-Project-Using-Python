## 1. Introduction
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model for estimating salaries based on various features. Several machine learning models are used, and their performance is compared to select the best model.

## 2. Data Loading and Preprocessing
The dataset is loaded and various preprocessing steps are performed, including:

Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables
Splitting the data into training and testing sets
## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is conducted to understand the data better. This includes:

Visualizing the distribution of numerical features
Examining the relationship between features and the target variable (salary)
Checking for correlations among features
## 4. Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is performed to create new features and enhance the predictive power of the models. Steps include:

Creating polynomial features
Scaling features
Encoding categorical variables
## 5. Model Building
Several machine learning models are trained, including:

Multiple Linear Regression (using Statsmodels and Sklearn)
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Machines Regressor
XGBoost Regressor
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
AdaBoost Regressor
## 6. Model Evaluation
The models are evaluated using the R-squared (R²) score. Here are the R² scores for all models:

Multiple Linear Regression (Statsmodels): 0.534
Multiple Linear Regression (Sklearn): 0.5343
Decision Tree Regressor: 0.5928
Random Forest Regressor: 0.6601
Gradient Boosting Machines Regressor: 0.6327
XGBoost Regressor: 0.6613
Ridge Regression: 0.5356
Lasso Regression: 0.5356
AdaBoost Regressor: 0.6065
The Random Forest Regressor and XGBoost Regressor provided the best performance with R² scores of 0.6601 and 0.6613, respectively.

## 7. Model Improvement
To further improve the model's performance, the following steps are suggested:

Gathering more data
Fine-tuning model hyperparameters
Adding more relevant features and performing advanced feature engineering
Using ensemble techniques
Implementing early stopping to prevent overfitting
## 8. Conclusion
The notebook concludes that the Random Forest Regressor and XGBoost Regressor are the best models for predicting salaries in this scenario.
